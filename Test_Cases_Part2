# Scenario 1: Search Results Pagination

Scenario description: Testing pagination is crucial to ensure that the API handles large result sets gracefully and that the pagination information is correctly provided for clients to navigate through the results.

* Given: A client of the API
* When: A search for pages containing 'furry rabbits' is executed with a page limit set to 5
* Then: The API should return a paginated response with a maximum of 5 results per page. Verify that the pagination information is correctly structured, including the presence of next and previous links.


Scenario 2: Empty Search Results

Scenario Description: Verifying the API's behavior when no results are found is important to ensure that it handles such cases appropriately and communicates this information clearly to the client.

* Given: A client of the API
* When: A search for pages containing a non-existent term, e.g., 'xylophone123'
* Then: The API should return an empty result set with proper indication that no matching pages were found.


Scenario 3: Invalid Search Term

Scenario Description: It's essential to test how the API handles invalid input to ensure that it provides informative error messages, helping developers understand and address the issue.

* Given: A client of the API
* When: A search is executed with an invalid or unsupported search term, e.g., special characters or an empty string
* Then: The API should return an error response with a meaningful error message indicating the issue.

Scenario 4: Special Characters in Search Term

Scenario Description: Testing with special characters helps ensure that the API handles them correctly, avoiding potential issues with URL encoding and search term interpretation.

* Given: A client of the API
* When: A search for pages containing a search term with special characters, e.g., 'c++ programming'
* Then: The API should correctly handle and interpret special characters, returning relevant results without errors.


Scenario 5: Search Term with Multiple Words

Scenario Description: Testing multi-word search terms ensures that the API correctly interprets and processes queries with spaces, delivering accurate and relevant results.

* Given: A client of the API
* When: A search for pages containing a multi-word search term, e.g., 'red roses'
* Then: The API should return results that match the entire phrase, and the relevance of results should be based on the complete term.

Scenario 6: Search Result Sorting

Scenario Description: Testing sorting functionality ensures that the API correctly orders search results based on the specified criteria, providing users with flexibility in result presentation.

* Given: A client of the API
* When: A search for pages containing 'furry rabbits' is executed with a specified sorting order (e.g., by relevance, date, or title)
* Then: The API should return results in the specified order, and the order should match the expected sorting criteria.
