Problem: 

To create a page via that API, you need to provide an Authorization Header. Describe how you would
adapt testing/automation?

Solution:

When dealing with an API that requires an Authorization Header for creating a page, 
testing and automation need to account for authentication and authorization aspects. 
Below are additional aspects to consider for testing and that might adapt ourself by testing and automation approach:

1. Authorization Header Handling:

   Test Case: Ensure that the system correctly handles the Authorization Header for creating a page.
   Automation: Write test cases to validate that the API rejects requests without a valid Authorization Header 
  and accepts requests with a valid one. Include scenarios with both correct and incorrect tokens to ensure proper handling of authorization.

2. Token Management:

   Test Case: Verify that the API handles various aspects of token management, such as token expiration, token refresh, and invalid tokens.
   Automation: Create test cases that simulate token expiration and refresh scenarios. 
   Ensure that the API returns the appropriate responses and refreshes the token seamlessly.

3. Access Control:

   Test Case: Validate that the API enforces proper access controls, ensuring that only authorized users can create pages.
   Automation: Create tests that attempt to create a page with different user roles (e.g., admin, regular user) and ensure that 
   unauthorized users receive appropriate error messages or status codes.

4. Rate Limiting:

   Test Case: Verify that the API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse.
   Automation: Design tests that exceed the allowed rate limit for creating pages and confirm 
   that the API responds with the expected rate-limiting messages.

5. Logging and Auditing:

   Test Case: Ensure that the API logs relevant information about page creation requests, including user details and timestamps.
   Automation: Develop tests to verify that the API logs information accurately and securely, with a focus on auditing capabilities for tracking user actions.

6. Error Handling:

    Test Case: Validate that the API provides meaningful error messages for various failure scenarios.
    Automation: Design tests to provoke errors, such as invalid JSON payload, missing required parameters, or 
    malformed Authorization Headers, and ensure the API responds with appropriate error codes and messages.

7. Data Validation:

    Test Case: Verify that the API performs proper validation on the data provided for creating a page.
    Automation: Create tests with invalid or incomplete data (e.g., missing title, empty content) 
    to confirm that the API rejects such requests and provides clear error messages.

8. Integration Testing:
   Test Case: Conduct end-to-end tests to verify the entire process of creating a page, 
    including the interaction between different components (database, authentication system, etc.).
   Automation: Develop tests that cover the entire workflow, from sending a request to creating a page to verifying the page's existence in the database.
